"""rl_model package for BloomSync AI toy reinforcement learning.

This package provides a safe, abstracted RL environment for sequence
optimization and a minimal REINFORCE agent to demonstrate training.

The repository contains lightweight, non-actionable placeholders that map to
the system architecture (encoder, policy, value, scorers, and constraints).
These modules are intentionally high-level and do not provide lab protocols.
